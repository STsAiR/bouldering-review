# bouldering-review page

## Introduction

This is a simple web application that allows users give comments on different bouldering gyms. The application is built using smart contract technology and react for the frontend. The smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum Test Network (Ethereum Sepolia). The frontend is built using React and connects to the smart contract using ethers.js.

The application allows users to add bouldering gyms, and leave reviews for the gyms. The reviews are stored on the blockchain, ensuring that they are immutable and transparent. The application also allows users to view reviews left by other users and see the average rating for each gym.

The page is currently hosted on [Github Pages](https://stsair.github.io/bouldering-review), and the smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia Test Network with contract adress `0xe2978036e3813bb6a191fbf20f5adacb036facbf`. The application uses MetaMask for user authentication, allowing users to connect their Ethereum wallets and interact with the smart contract.
